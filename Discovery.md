# About the App

Whiteboard is a drawing application where you can reflect your thoughts. It helps you convey your ideas in a more colorful and vivid way.

# Concept

It allows you to visualize all your ideas instead of putting them in plain text. Shapes, icons, emojis... it allows you to use them in the simplest but most effective way. You can share your drawings with anyone, all the images you add are stored in Deta Drive.

**Look at an example**: [https://whiteboard-1-g2352340.deta.app/view/0rr42s7b1x8y](https://whiteboard-1-g2352340.deta.app/view/0rr42s7b1x8y)

Although there is no tool for this, use the view path instead of edit to share the project:
The url for editing looks like this: `https://whiteboard-1-g2352340.deta.app/edit/0rr42s7b1x8y`
Add view instead of edit: `https://whiteboard-1-g2352340.deta.app/view/0rr42s7b1x8y`

# Not completed!

Problems that cannot be solved due to lack of time:

- The created project cannot be deleted (this is not so bad).
- The created page cannot be deleted (which is a bit bad).
- Resources may load late, so you may see names instead of icons the first time, fonts may look broken, and you won't know the images are there until they load.
* It does not ask for names when creating a project and adds random images.
* It may take a few seconds to save the changes.
