# About the App

Whiteboard is a drawing application where you can reflect your thoughts. It helps you convey your ideas in a more colorful and vivid way.

# Concept

It allows you to visualize all your ideas instead of putting them in plain text. Shapes, icons, emojis... it allows you to use them in the simplest but most effective way. You can share your drawings with anyone, all the images you add are stored in Deta Drive.

# Not completed!

Features I don't have time for:

- The created project cannot be deleted (this is not so bad).
- The created page cannot be deleted (which is a bit bad).
